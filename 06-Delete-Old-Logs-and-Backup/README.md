# Log Management Scripts ‚Äì Clean, Backup & Automate Like a Pro

Two production-ready Bash scripts for efficient `.log` file **cleanup** and **backup**, built with best practices in mind: **safe deletion, automation, color-coded logging, error handling, and root access validation**.


## Common Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Root access** check with exit on failure  
- üé® **Color-coded output** (Success, Error, Warning)  
- üß† **Reusable functions** for validation and status display  
- üìú **Execution logs** stored at `/var/log/shellscript-logs/`  
- üì¶ Designed for **cron automation** and real-world scenarios

## 1. `delete-old-logs.sh`

> Automatically delete `.log` files older than 14 days from a defined directory.

### Configuration
- Set `SOURCE_DIR` inside the script (default: `/home/ec2-user/app-logs`)

### What It Does
- Finds all `.log` files older than 14 days  
- Deletes them safely  
- Logs each deletion to a file  
- Outputs **status** in color (green for success, red for failure)

### Sample Output

        Script started executing at 2025-05-27 12:00:00
        Deleting file: /home/ec2-user/app-logs/error log 1.log
        Deleting /home/ec2-user/app-logs/error log 1.log is ...  SUCCESS
        Script finished executing at 2025-05-27 12:00:01



# 2. backup-logs.sh

Backup and clean .log files older than N days with zip and validation

**Usage**

        sudo bash backup-logs.sh <source-dir> <destination-dir> [days]


- <source-dir> ‚Äì Directory with .log files

- <destination-dir> ‚Äì Backup output directory

- [days] ‚Äì (Optional) Files older than N days (default: 14)

**Example**

        sudo bash backup-logs.sh /var/log/nginx /mnt/backups 30



- Finds .log files older than 30 days

- Creates a timestamped .zip file (e.g., app-logs-2025-05-27-12-30-00.zip)

- Deletes originals only if backup succeeds

- Logs all actions to /var/log/shellscript-logs/backup.log


## üîÅ Automation with Cron

Automate cleanup and backup using cron jobs:

        crontab -e


Example: Run backup every day at 2 AM:


        0 2 * * * /bin/bash /home/user/scripts/backup-logs.sh /var/log/myapp /mnt/backups 7


## Use Cases

- CI/CD log rotation

- Nginx/Apache log cleanup

- Application log backups

- Reduce disk usage on production servers


## üìö Learning Objectives

This project helps you understand:

-  find, rm, zip, tee, read, basename

-  Bash scripting best practices (modular functions, root checks)

-  Logging and observability

-  Real-world Linux scripting automation
