What is Shell Scripting?

Shell Scripting is like handing your computer a checklist. You write a bunch of commands in a text file—stuff you’d normally type into the terminal—and then run that file like a program. It’s a simple yet powerful way to tell your computer what to do, step by step.

Why I’m Learning Shell Scripting
Here’s why I think Shell Scripting is so cool and worth learning:

Saves Time: Automating repetitive tasks feels like magic! 
Career Boost: It’s a key skill for roles like DevOps Engineer, System Admin, and Cloud Engineer. 
System Insights: It’s a window into how Linux systems tick under the hood. 
Mini-Programs: I can write scripts to install software, back up files, monitor logs, and more. 

A Simple Analogy
Picture this:
Open a book.
Read the first 3 pages.
Close the book.
Instead of doing those steps manually every time, you jot them down on a piece of paper. Now, whenever you want, you just follow the paper, and boom—it’s done! That’s what a Shell Script does for your computer: it automates the steps so you don’t have to repeat yourself.

 
 
What Does a Shell Script Look Like?
Here’s a super simple example:

     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Hello, this is my first shell script!"
     #!/bin/bash tells the system to use the Bash shell.
     echo prints a message to the screen.


Real-Life Examples of Shell Scripts
Shell Scripts are everywhere in IT. Here are some ways they’re used:

estarting servers automatically.
Creating daily backups.
Installing software with one command.
Analyzing logs and saving the results for later.
These practical applications are what excite me most—I can’t wait to build scripts that solve real problems!

''No Coding Experience? No Problem!''

I’m starting from zero as a non-IT student, so this repo is 100% beginner-friendly. If you’re new to coding or IT like me, don’t sweat it—we’re in this together! I’ve designed everything to be step-by-step, so we can build a solid base in automation and DevOps from scratch.
