##  Script in this Folder

### `01-hello-script.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Author: Harshavardhan Nandigama
# Date: 2025-05-25
# Description: This script shows the use of metadata and prints system info
# Version: 1.0
# License: MIT

# Print a welcome message
    echo "Welcome to my metadata example shell script"

# Print hostname
    echo "Hostname of this system: $(hostname)"

# Print current user
    echo "You are logged in as: $USER"

    echo "Today is: $(date)"
```

##  Key Concepts

###  What is Shebang?

Shebang (`#!`) is the first line in a shell script that tells the OS which interpreter to use to run the script. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This means: ‚ÄúUse the **Bash shell** to execute this script.‚Äù

### What is Metadata in Shell Script?

Metadata is information *about* the script, like:

* Author name
* Creation date
* Description
* Version
* License

It helps others understand the purpose and origin of the script.

## Output Example

```
Welcome to my metadata example shell script
Hostname of this system: myhost.local
You are logged in as: harshavardhan
Today is: Sat May 25 19:15:00 IST 2025
```

## Takeaways

* Always start a script with the correct **shebang**.
* Add **metadata comments** for clarity and professionalism.
* Use `echo` and shell commands like `hostname`, `date`, and `$USER` to create informative output.
